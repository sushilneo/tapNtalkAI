**Your Speak Buddy for Non-Verbal Students**  
Empowering students with speech impairments to express themselves — clearly, quickly, and confidently.

## 🎯 What is TapNTalk AI?
TapNTalk AI is an assistive AI-powered web app designed for students who face difficulty speaking. It converts simple gestures, typed messages, and urgent phrases into natural spoken language using AI rephrasing and voice synthesis.

Built with inclusivity at its core, TapNTalk AI bridges the communication gap between non-verbal students and educators — fostering clearer interaction, quicker support, and deeper understanding.
